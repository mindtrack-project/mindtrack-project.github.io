        MindTrack is an innovative initiative that examines adolescent online behavior using a
        holistic approach to detect, prevent, and predict adolescent mental health problems.
        Acknowledging the growing role of social media in young people’s lives, the project taps
        into this rich source of information to gain insights into their emotional well-being. This
        project’s holistic approach is based on the existing correlation between the surrounding
        environment (external factors), the content generated in social media (internal factors),
        and young people’s mental health. This proposal is to work with external factors.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          In an increasingly digitized world, mental health issues among teenagers have escalated to
          alarming proportions. Recent data by the US Department of Health & Human Services shows
          that nearly 50% of people have had a mental health disorder at some point in their lives.
          More importantly, these afflictions often find a voice on the very platforms these young
          individuals navigate daily, such as social media.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          With its broad reach and immersive influence, social media is an intrinsic part of most
          teenagers’ lives. As per a 2022 survey by Smart Social, approximately 95% of teenagers in
          the United States have access to a smartphone, enabling them to check social media
          multiple times a day, making it an influential part of their socialization process. The
          same platforms that offer connectivity and expression can unwittingly become a medium
          through which the teenagers’ mental distress is projected, often unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          The traces of these psychological issues can be observed in their digital footprints: the
          posts they share, the comments they leave, and the amount of time they spend or withdraw
          from these platforms. The harbingers could be subtle, increased self-deprecating humor, a
          consistent tone of pessimism, or an unexplained period of inactivity. These may seem like
          typical teenage behavior, but collectively, they often reflect the tip of an iceberg,
          signaling underlying mental health concerns.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          These problems demand immediate attention as they profoundly affect the individual’s
          development and overall well-being. If left unaddressed, mental health issues can lead to
          impaired social functioning, poor academic performance, and increased risk of substance
          abuse and suicide. These statistics are particularly concerning given that suicide is the
          second-leading cause of death among teenagers aged 15 to 24 years in the USA, according to
          the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          However, detecting these signs early through their online presence and intervening
          effectively can significantly improve the teenager’s mental health outcome. Thus, the
          symbiotic relationship between teenagers’ mental health and their social media activities
          is significant, demanding urgent and dedicated research.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          Identifying this intersection between mental health and social media offers a unique
          opportunity to intercept the trajectory of these problems. Developing tools and strategies
          to detect signs of distress from teenagers’ online behavior and provide appropriate
          assistance could be instrumental in curbing this growing mental health crisis.
